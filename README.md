# GPTcmd

This is a way to integrate AI into every Linux virtual machine CMD

This isn't a complete project and isn't made to be compatible with Windows

To run this, read the code, and configure the IP of the API (you can make your own). It just requests the API, and the API should redirect the contents of the request to the AI that is running locally

The whole purpose of this is to bypass the need for WSL CUDA and be able to get a shell GPT without an OpenAI API key


Everything is in the master branch
